## üß† Research Activities

I am deeply engaged in understanding and modeling the complex relationship between pain and pleasure within the Motivation-Emotion-Cognition loop. My approach involves using robotics as both tools and models, contributing to the broader field of affective cognition and neurocybernetics.

## ‚úä Numeric activism

I am committed to helping progressives, social democrats and ecologists  in their quest for lasting societal transformation. I firmly believe that data and technology should serve the cause of justice and human progress. With this vision, I am developing tools and projects such as [VotAction](https://github.com/lharidonlouis/votaction), a platform designed to empower social justice and environmental activists in France, enabling them to deeply understand local data and win elections, polling station by polling station.
